 **MangosZero - Vanilla WoW Database**
===

This is the database to support the MangosZero server.

It aims to be 100% compatible with the 3 final versions of Vanilla [World of Warcraft][2], 
namely [patch 1.12.1][4], [patch 1.12.2][5] & [patch 1.12.3][6].
<br>**IT DOES NOT SUPPORT 1.13.x** and beyond which is the newly released Classic Experience (NuClassic).

Dependencies
------------
The server stands on the shoulders of several well-known Open Source libraries plus
a few awesome, but less known libraries to prevent us from inventing the wheel again.

**Please note that Linux and Mac OS X users should install packages using
their systems package management instead of source packages.**

* **[MySQL][40]** / **[MariaDB][41]**: These databases are used to store content and user data.

<br>We have a small, but extremely friendly and helpful community managed by MadMax and Antz.


Our discord/forum motto is: 
```js
'Be nice or Be somewhere else'
```
Any trolling or unpleasantness is swiftly dealt with !!
