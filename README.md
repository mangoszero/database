 **MangosZero - Vanilla WoW Database**
===

This is the database to support the MangosZero server.

It aims to be 100% compatible with the 3 final versions of Vanilla [World of Warcraft][2], 
namely [patch 1.12.1][4], [patch 1.12.2][5] & [patch 1.12.3][6].
<br>**IT DOES NOT SUPPORT 1.13.x** and beyond which is the newly released Classic Experience (NuClassic).

Dependencies
------------
The server stands on the shoulders of several well-known Open Source libraries plus
a few awesome, but less known libraries to prevent us from inventing the wheel again.

**Please note that Linux and Mac OS X users should install packages using
their systems package management instead of source packages.**

* **MySQL** / **MariaDB**: to store content, and user data, we rely on
  [MySQL][40]/[MariaDB][41] to handle data.

<br>We have a small, but extremely friendly and helpful community managed by MadMax and Antz.
<br>Any trolling or unpleasantness is swiftly dealt with !!
* Our discord/forum motto is "Be nice or Be somewhere else"

**Official Website**
----

We welcome anyone who is interested in enjoying older versions of wow or contributing and helping out !
