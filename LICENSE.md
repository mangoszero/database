The **MaNGOS** world Database is copyright of the respective authors, and is available

except where explicitly stated otherwise.

Our license
-----------
Licenses and their meaning can be scary at times but rest assured the
[Creative Commons][2] licenses are simple, precise, and beneficial for us,
and you, too!

Your rights
-----------
You may **share our work** with the world! This including copying, distribution,
and transmission of our work. No hidden fees here, we want you to enjoy what
we provide, and the more, the merrier.

But what would content be worth if it could not be used to create new stuff?
*Not much.* We think so, too, and thus you may **remix our content**. Wait,
what is remixing? That does sound a whole lot like music or video stuff! No,
silly! Remixing describes that you may build upon our content, adapt it for
your needs, and build new content out of it.

Your duties
-----------
Everyone wants to be appreciated, and so do we! If you make use of the
rights we give to you, we expect **attribution** from you. This is pretty
simple: you have to make clear, who authored the work we did for you. A
suggestion is that if you use a copyright or licence header for every file,
to include attribution there, e.g. "based upon the work of getmangos.eu".
You may include further details, bot no less than that.

Now here is an important rule: do not make money by using our work! We provide
this content only for **non-commercial** use. If you desire to use our
content for commercial purposes, you may contact us for a commercial license.

The final of your duties is *the* central rule for us: if you alter,
transform, or build upon this work, you *have* to distribute the resulting
work only under the **same or similar license* to this one. Why? Because
using our work, and hiding your remixes is just bad. Nobody will benefit
from that. Again, if you desire to do something with our work, and not
release your remixes, you may ask us for a commercial license.
