## So you want to contribute with translations?

We are very happy to receive help in this work, since it's a very huge one and you don't need particular programming skills to do it. I'm writing here just some thing you should keep in mind while working, to have a coherent translation betweeen every localization:
* Don't translate proper noun. Sylvana Windrunner will remain Sylvana Windrunner. You should, however, translate subtitle (like, in this case, "Banshee Queen");
* If you translate the name of an item, remember that it could be used for a quest or in some flavour text in the game. Double check that they are translated in the same way (as a player, it wouldn't be fun the run all over the world to search for an item that as a different name as you expect);
* Don't translate name that are listed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_trJLEK2IH88zeVbraY2qTGHeDTg8Uv5uYaiClvKWy8/pubhtml). This because these places name are also appearing as the player travel through the map (on screen and in the map itself), and they are not translatable there, so again we would have a confused player looking for a place that is nowhere to be found on the map.
* If you find something in rhyme (like [here](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=2004) at page 4, day seven) don't translate it literally, but try to keep the rhyme in the language you are translating to.

This said, thank you very much for every contribution you would like to share with us!
